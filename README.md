# MethodswithLoopsandConditionals

	          * Create a method for each of the given challenges below:
            Constraints:
                - Use as many descriptive names as possible.
                - For training purposes, most if not all the data for these methods can come from user input.
                - Each one of these methods should be called from Main() and declared in the Program class. 
                - Be as creative as you want, the goal is to have working methods but if you want to make them look nice, go for it.
                - This project should work in a manner where if someone forks/clones this from GitHub, they can just press the play button and have every method run in sequence, 
                - so all interface dialogue should be in place already.
